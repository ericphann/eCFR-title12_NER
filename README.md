# ‚öñÔ∏è NER Models - eCFR Title 12 üè¶

Fine-tuned NER models for banking and regulation texts, trained on eCFR Title 12 using manual and few-shot (GPT 3.5 v3) annotations.  

Please see the [executive write-up](https://github.com/ericphann/eCFR-title12_NER/blob/main/write-up.pdf) for metrics and process details.

## Dataset
- Domain: Banking compliance and risk
- Possible applications: NER, text mining, classification, policy, regulations 
- eCFR Title 12 (https://github.com/ericphann/dsba6188-group6-project/tree/main/data)

## Processing
- Generate Entity Labels, Definitions, and Few-shot Data
- Train/Test a Model Using ecfr-few-shot.jsonl
- Compile Metrics and Review
- Label 100 examples from ecfr-unlabeled.jsonl
- Review Labels and Refine Annotation Guidelines
- Create a Final Test Dataset (ecfr-manual.jsonl)
- Model Development

## Models
- few-shot-model
- manual-model
- mixed-model

## Future Work
- Refine Annotation Guidelines
- Expand Dataset
- Fine-tuning with Prodigy and SpaCy
- Chunking Data
- Data Privacy and Security
